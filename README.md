# WheresTheGrub
WheresTheGrub was a project I started back in 2016. I spent hundreds of hours developing it. I planned to run a full sales team out of my apartment and start my own version of yelp/zomato. However life happened and I couldn't afford to continue. Instead of letting this project sit and rot in private. Here it is in public. 


This project is not for commercial use. If you want to use my code for commercial purposes, please send me an email at opanelj@gmail.com.
